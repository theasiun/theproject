                        Wall Street Journalist Wendy Bounds discusses the seriousness of the effects of violence in movies and media with Youtube Programming Director Marshall Crook. They discuss all the potential factors and how their effects.

Parents must be aware that their are risk factors in watching these movies like mental illnesses or unhealthy ideas and thinking.

                        Reasearch has been done for the last 50 years, continuous exposure to violence do increase rates of violent thoughts and behaviors. However, there is not enough evidence to prove there is a direct correlation. It depends greatly on a variety of factors like characteristics. Everyone even adults and elderly are at risk as well. The most important thing to remember is that parent sneed to pay attention to what their children are watching, what their children's specific needs are, and who/where their children watch these types of content.
