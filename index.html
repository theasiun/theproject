            <h2 class="heading">What is the Problem?</h2>
            <p>There is a lot of controversial content in public programs such as in television and movies. They permeate the way we think and act in everyday life. However, our foremost concern should be the effects of violent content on the general populace. In 2016 alone, approximately 2,000 pre-teens and teenagers were convicted of murder. These numbers only included those that were successful, not to mention those who attempted but failed to kill people. Seven people are shot every 60 minutes and 3 are killed per hour. How many of these unnecessary deaths and murders could have been prevented? What leads people to think they can take people's lives away? It is mediaâ€¦</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Unnecessary Exposure</h2>
            <p>Many children including teenagers are unnecessarily exposed to violent content in movies and television shows. In a study from 2003, 40 different violent movies were approximately seen by 22 million U.S. children aged between 10 and 14 years old. Many of these movies were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America and UK 18 by British Board of Film Classification. These children should not have seen these movies. When a movie is rated R, all children under the age of 17 years old must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Nowadays, children's parents do not understand the seriousness and effects that such content will have on their children's lives.</p>
            
            <h2 class="heading">Why is it bad?</h2>
            <p>Frequent exposure to violent movies cause children to have frightening symptoms and can be a hinderance in their development and growth. Frequent exposure to violent material will also cause children to become insensitive to real life human suffering. Children also have a natural tendency to do what is forbidden or not allowed. After watching these kinds of movies, statistics have shown there is a growth in the urge to commit violence, drink, alcohol, among many other things.</p>
            
            <h2 class="heading">Solution and Treatment</h2>
            <p>The best way to solve the problem is quite simple. Many people and families have tried to make it so that their children can't watch any violent movies until they are an adult. However, that plan always backfires because it will make the child want to do it more and in a place where they cannot be monitored. The best solution is to reach an understanding and to compromise between the parents and children. They should allow their children to watch movies but they must set ground rules for the movies that they can watch.</p>
